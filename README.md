# nodejs-api-examples

In this repository you can find different exmaples of Node.js APIs from very basic to complex back-ends.
Look at comments in the code and packages used in each project.
A lot of things can be improved or changed, the idea is to have good examples of the most cases for back-end apps so you can copy and paste
in your project, or at least have an idea how to implement different features.

List of projects, from basic to complex:

- PLANETS. Just functions, not a server. Handling CSVs files, `FS` package and package.json.
- HTTP-SERVER. Node.js server using node's built-in packages. Very basic, just raw functionality of a "server".
- EXPRESS-API. Express API server, some CRUD actions, static assets serving, MVC pattern, Express router.
- NASA Project. _Description (WIP)_ See commits to understand code, decisions, comments and iterations.
